#WIP Shlink Go

This is a work in progress in very early stages. It's subject to many changes and should not be used!

Shlink Go is an implementation of Shlink, of which the PHP version was made by Alejandro Celaya. The Original Work website is [https://shlink.io/](https://shlink.io/)

It aims to be, eventually, a drop in replacement for Shlink, with similar API, CLI and DB capabilities.

Right now it's meant to be a learning experience as I just started getting into Go. Any constructive criticism is welcome.

Current Roadmap:

1. Basic CLI and Service
2. Unit Testing
3. REST API using Gin
4. Implement visits functionality
